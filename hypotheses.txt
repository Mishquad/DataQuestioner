### Hypotheses

1. **Column Order and Names**:
   - Hypothesis: The discrepancy in column names and order might be due to different data collection methods or software versions used to generate the datasets.
   - Hypothesis: The additional column `extra_column` in the current dataset could be a result of a new data collection process or a change in the data schema.

2. **Missing Values**:
   - Hypothesis: The increase in NaN values in the `salary`, `email`, and `phone` columns could be due to data entry errors or incomplete data collection processes.
   - Hypothesis: The discrepancy in NaN values might be due to different data cleaning procedures applied to the datasets.

3. **Irregular Values**:
   - Hypothesis: The increase in rows with `age` values less than 18 could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
   - Hypothesis: The increase in negative values in the `salary` column could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
   - Hypothesis: The increase in future dates in the `hire_date` column could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.

4. **Patterns**:
   - Hypothesis: The change in patterns in the `department`, `job_title`, `status`, and `notes` columns could be due to organizational changes or different data collection methods.
   - Hypothesis: The discrepancy in patterns might be due to different data analysis or reporting processes applied to the datasets.

5. **Data Type Mismatches**:
   - Hypothesis: The data type mismatch in the `hire_date` column could be due to different data collection methods or software versions used to generate the datasets.
   - Hypothesis: The data type mismatch in the `salary` column could be due to different data collection methods or software versions used to generate the datasets.

6. **Duplicate Rows**:
   - Hypothesis: The increase in duplicate rows could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
   - Hypothesis: The discrepancy in duplicate rows might be due to different data cleaning procedures applied to the datasets.

7. **Outliers**:
   - Hypothesis: The increase in outliers in the `salary` column could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
   - Hypothesis: The discrepancy in outliers might be due to different data analysis or reporting processes applied to the datasets.

### Suggestions

1. **Column Order and Names**:
   - Suggestion: Standardize the column names and order across both datasets to ensure consistency.
   - Suggestion: Investigate the source of the `extra_column` in the current dataset and decide whether it should be included in the base dataset.

2. **Missing Values**:
   - Suggestion: Implement a consistent data cleaning procedure to handle missing values in the `salary`, `email`, and `phone` columns.
   - Suggestion: Investigate the source of missing values and address any data entry errors or incomplete data collection processes.

3. **Irregular Values**:
   - Suggestion: Implement data validation rules to ensure that `age` values are within a reasonable range.
   - Suggestion: Implement data validation rules to ensure that `salary` values are non-negative.
   - Suggestion: Implement data validation rules to ensure that `hire_date` values are not in the future.

4. **Patterns**:
   - Suggestion: Investigate the organizational changes or different data collection methods that might have caused the discrepancy in patterns.
   - Suggestion: Implement a consistent data analysis or reporting process to ensure consistency across both datasets.

5. **Data Type Mismatches**:
   - Suggestion: Standardize the data types of the `hire_date` and `salary` columns across both datasets.
   - Suggestion: Investigate the source of the data type mismatches and address any differences in data collection methods or software versions.

6. **Duplicate Rows**:
   - Suggestion: Implement a consistent data cleaning procedure to handle duplicate rows.
   - Suggestion: Investigate the source of duplicate rows and address any data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.

7. **Outliers**:
   - Suggestion: Implement data validation rules to ensure that `salary` values are within a reasonable range.
   - Suggestion: Investigate the source of outliers and address any data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
