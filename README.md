# DataQuestioner


LLM-based system for automated business data analysis, hypothesis generation, and validation using Mistral-based models.
Core idea is to regularly check for data-drift (whatever that means)

as a data example I took [coffeshop daily transactions data from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungpambudi/trends-product-coffee-shop-sales-revenue-dataset)
