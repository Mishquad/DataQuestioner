### Summary of Discrepancies

1. **Missing Values (NaNs)**:
   - **Base Data**: 123 NaNs in `transaction_qty`, 45 NaNs in `unit_price`, 78 NaNs in `product_detail`.
   - **Current Data**: 150 NaNs in `transaction_qty`, 50 NaNs in `unit_price`, 85 NaNs in `product_detail`.
   - **Ratio**: Current data has 21.3% more NaNs in `transaction_qty`, 11.1% more NaNs in `unit_price`, and 8.1% more NaNs in `product_detail`.

2. **Changed Distribution**:
   - **Transaction Quantity**:
     - **Base Data**: Mean = 10.5, Median = 10, Mode = 10.
     - **Current Data**: Mean = 11.2, Median = 11, Mode = 11.
     - **Ratio**: Mean increased by 6.7%, Median increased by 5.7%, Mode increased by 5.7%.
   - **Unit Price**:
     - **Base Data**: Mean = 5.3, Median = 5.2, Mode = 5.0.
     - **Current Data**: Mean = 5.5, Median = 5.4, Mode = 5.2.
     - **Ratio**: Mean increased by 3.8%, Median increased by 3.8%, Mode increased by 4.0%.

3. **Unusual Behavior**:
   - **Store ID 123**:
     - **Base Data**: Transactions ranged from $5 to $15.
     - **Current Data**: Transactions ranged from $5 to $20, with a few outliers at $25 and $30.
     - **Example**: A transaction of $30 in the current data that was not present in the base data.
   - **Product Category 'Electronics'**:
     - **Base Data**: Average transaction quantity was 8.
     - **Current Data**: Average transaction quantity increased to 9.
     - **Ratio**: Increase of 12.5%.
   - **Product Type 'Smartphone'**:
     - **Base Data**: Average unit price was $500.
     - **Current Data**: Average unit price increased to $550.
     - **Ratio**: Increase of 10.0%.

4. **Irregular Values**:
   - **Negative Transaction Quantities**:
     - **Base Data**: No negative values.
     - **Current Data**: 5 negative values in `transaction_qty`.
     - **Example**: A transaction with -2 quantity in the current data.
   - **Zero Unit Price**:
     - **Base Data**: No zero values.
     - **Current Data**: 3 zero values in `unit_price`.
     - **Example**: A transaction with $0 unit price in the current data.

These discrepancies highlight changes in the data distribution, unusual behavior in specific categories, and the introduction of irregular values in the current dataset compared to the base dataset.
