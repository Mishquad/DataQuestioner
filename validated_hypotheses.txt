### Validated Hypotheses

1. **Column Order and Names**:
   - **Hypothesis**: The discrepancy in column names and order might be due to different data collection methods or software versions used to generate the datasets.
     - **Explanation**: Different data collection methods or software versions can lead to variations in column names and order. Standardizing these elements ensures consistency across datasets.
   - **Hypothesis**: The additional column `extra_column` in the current dataset could be a result of a new data collection process or a change in the data schema.
     - **Explanation**: A new data collection process or a change in the data schema can introduce additional columns. Investigating the source of `extra_column` is crucial for understanding its relevance.

2. **Missing Values**:
   - **Hypothesis**: The increase in NaN values in the `salary`, `email`, and `phone` columns could be due to data entry errors or incomplete data collection processes.
     - **Explanation**: Data entry errors or incomplete data collection processes can lead to missing values. Implementing consistent data cleaning procedures can help address these issues.
   - **Hypothesis**: The discrepancy in NaN values might be due to different data cleaning procedures applied to the datasets.
     - **Explanation**: Different data cleaning procedures can result in variations in the number of missing values. Standardizing these procedures ensures consistency.

3. **Irregular Values**:
   - **Hypothesis**: The increase in rows with `age` values less than 18 could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
     - **Explanation**: Data entry errors or intentional data manipulation can lead to irregular values. Implementing data validation rules can help ensure data accuracy.
   - **Hypothesis**: The increase in negative values in the `salary` column could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
     - **Explanation**: Data entry errors or intentional data manipulation can lead to negative values. Implementing data validation rules can help ensure data accuracy.
   - **Hypothesis**: The increase in future dates in the `hire_date` column could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
     - **Explanation**: Data entry errors or intentional data manipulation can lead to future dates. Implementing data validation rules can help ensure data accuracy.

4. **Patterns**:
   - **Hypothesis**: The change in patterns in the `department`, `job_title`, `status`, and `notes` columns could be due to organizational changes or different data collection methods.
     - **Explanation**: Organizational changes or different data collection methods can lead to variations in patterns. Investigating these changes is crucial for understanding the underlying factors.
   - **Hypothesis**: The discrepancy in patterns might be due to different data analysis or reporting processes applied to the datasets.
     - **Explanation**: Different data analysis or reporting processes can result in variations in patterns. Standardizing these processes ensures consistency.

5. **Data Type Mismatches**:
   - **Hypothesis**: The data type mismatch in the `hire_date` column could be due to different data collection methods or software versions used to generate the datasets.
     - **Explanation**: Different data collection methods or software versions can lead to data type mismatches. Standardizing data types ensures consistency.
   - **Hypothesis**: The data type mismatch in the `salary` column could be due to different data collection methods or software versions used to generate the datasets.
     - **Explanation**: Different data collection methods or software versions can lead to data type mismatches. Standardizing data types ensures consistency.

6. **Duplicate Rows**:
   - **Hypothesis**: The increase in duplicate rows could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
     - **Explanation**: Data entry errors or intentional data manipulation can lead to duplicate rows. Implementing consistent data cleaning procedures can help address these issues.
   - **Hypothesis**: The discrepancy in duplicate rows might be due to different data cleaning procedures applied to the datasets.
     - **Explanation**: Different data cleaning procedures can result in variations in the number of duplicate rows. Standardizing these procedures ensures consistency.

7. **Outliers**:
   - **Hypothesis**: The increase in outliers in the `salary` column could be due to data entry errors or intentional data manipulation.
     - **Explanation**: Data entry errors or intentional data manipulation can lead to outliers. Implementing data validation rules can help ensure data accuracy.
   - **Hypothesis**: The discrepancy in outliers might be due to different data analysis or reporting processes applied to the datasets.
     - **Explanation**: Different data analysis or reporting processes can result in variations in outliers. Standardizing these processes ensures consistency.
